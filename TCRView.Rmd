# Paired-chain T cell receptor (TCR) reference dataset visualization

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("./util/library.R")
source("./util/plotting.R")
library(rstudioapi)
library(plotly)
```

```{r data-import}



```

## Introduction: Components of the TCR:pMHC complex

```{r vj-genes}



```



```{r epitopes}

# Epitope distribution

# Epitope counts table (highest to lowest abundance)

# Epitopes per epitope species (plotly dropdown to filter)


```


```{r mhc}

# MHC group distribution

# MHC counts table

# MHC alleles per group (plotly dropdown to filter)


```


## Complex relationships in TCR:pMHC complexes

```{r vj-sankey}

# V J gene profile sankey diagrams
# Dropdown to filter by epitope, epitope species, MHC group

```


```{r cdr3-length}

# CDR3 alpha and beta lengths
# Dropdown to color by V gene family, J gene family, MHC


```


```{r cdr-clust}

# UMAP coordinates 
# Dropdown to overlay with V genes, J genes, epitope specificity, MHC group


```


```{r cdr3-motif}

# CDR3 motifs 
# Dropdown to filter by epitope, epitope species, MHC group

```
